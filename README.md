# Advent of Code 2022
My solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) using Rust.

All the examples can be tested by running `cat input.txt | cargo run <day1|day2|...>` for the respective day.

## Day 1

## Day 2
Once again using [nom](https://docs.rs/nom/latest/nom/), a combinator parser framework. I'm hoping to get more proficient with it over time as it's quite time consuming to figure out which combinators and parsers to pick.

## Day 3
I don't like the number duplication in the hashmap but I'm too lazy to rewrite it again.

## Day 4

## Day 5
